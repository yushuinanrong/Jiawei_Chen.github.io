Hello, I'm Jiawei Chen. I'm a forth-year PhD student at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Boston University, supervised by [Prof.Janusz Korand](https://www.bu.edu/eng/profile/janusz-konrad/) and [Prof.Prakash Ishwar](https://www.bu.edu/eng/profile/prakash-ishwar/). My research focuses on _privacy-preserving visual analysis of human activity_ using deep-learning/machine-learning methodolgies. 

Before starting my PhD in 2015, I did my master at Duke University and undergraduate at Harbin Institute of Technology. I'm originally from Jiaxing, a beautiful city lying on the Grand Canal of China. 

I like basketball and scoccer. My faverite sprot players are [Cristiano Ronaldo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristiano_Ronaldo) and [LeBron James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James). 
I also enjoy reading and writing. My faviote writer is [Agatha Christie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agatha_Christie).
